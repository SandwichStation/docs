### What should I work on?

* Talk to current developers in Discord.
* Check [the roadmap](https://trello.com/b/vNj28tK2/sandwichstation) for anything you can work on.

### What repositories are part of Space Station 14?
* [SandwichStation](https://github.com/SandwichStation/SandwichStation) is the main codebase. It has the most priority issues.

#### There are other repositories that do not have as many priority issues to work on. If you are still curious about them, they are here:
* [SandwichStation Docker](https://github.com/SandwichStation/SandwichStation-Docker) is the backend container running our server.
* [SandwichStation Wiki](https://github.com/SandwichStation/wiki) this is the crew wiki.
* [SandwichStation Docs](https://github.com/SandwichStation/docs) this is the page your currently reading :wave:
